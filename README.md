# Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am TomÃ¡Å¡, and I like to do all sorts of stuff.

# What can I do
I know some Python, HTML and CSS, little bit of JavaScript. Recently I started learnign Unity and C#

# My hobbies
Recently i switched my main OS from Windows to Linux. To be specific I did some distro-hopping, I started with Ubuntu, but then I broke it, and i wanted to try Pop-OS!, so I tried Pop-OS!. Then I wanted to switch to KDE so i ~~logically~~tried Manjaro KDE, I was pretty happy with KDE and Manjaro, but Windows update broke my install so I installed Arch.
I also like to play games.
